# WaveSight V4 Automation Loop

## Daily production

`.github/workflows/daily-persistent-assets-pr.yml` owns the current commercial
event chain:

```text
independent source discovery
-> unified immutable snapshots + SOURCE-INTAKE-V1
-> V4 build / integrity / materialization
-> FDE and Hardware projections
-> Trend Radar / Funding Insights / Opportunity Map
-> COLLECTION-TELEMETRY-V1.0 / OPS synchronization
-> V4-only pre-commit readiness
-> PR / merge / Pages
```

`.github/workflows/daily-production-chain-dry-run.yml` tests the same ownership
without publishing.

Card generation, Pool-to-Card, Card editorial, V3 desk, old graph, compatibility
frontstage, legacy mapping, and their staging steps are disabled. Raw and Pool
candidate Markdown are no longer written. Immutable original snapshots remain.

## Lane independence

- First-Line Viewpoints (`O`) and Community Intelligence (`C`) keep independent
  collection, gate, and publication lanes.
- Commercial events (`E`) use accepted V4 Claims and sources only.
- Operations output (`OPS`) stays in telemetry/reports and cannot become public
  evidence.
- Report generation remains independent from Opportunity Map generation.
- FDE/Hardware sync depends on V4 integrity/materialization, never V3 gates.

## Recovery

Health dispatch reads the V4 manifest and `COLLECTION-TELEMETRY-V1.0`. An
accepted V4 batch must not trigger source recollection because an archived V3
asset is absent.

## Archive and Pages

V3 payload archives and `compatibility_cards` are absent from the working tree.
Production cannot discover them; explicit historical recovery uses Git history
in an isolated temporary worktree.

Required policy gates:

```powershell
npm run assert:no-active-v3
npm run assert:pipeline-policy
npm run assert:compatibility-retirement
```
