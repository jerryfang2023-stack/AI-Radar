- fallback_used: Default monitor uses AI HOT daily feed first, AI HOT all-mode remainder second, then keyword rules. External multi-path keyword search and GDELT activate when the default lanes do not meet the Raw minimum, an importance type is thin, or important candidates lack original text / usable evidence object. HN is feedback only and must not dominate. GDELT failures fall back to A-tier media search.
- evidence_gaps: none
- report: agent-workflow/reports/2026-09-01-guanlan-monitor-quality-gate.md

## Retry Policy

- The production wrapper does not recollect all source lanes or rerun the full monitor automatically.
- Supply diagnostics remain in the report. A hard evidence-supply failure routes to targeted repair.
