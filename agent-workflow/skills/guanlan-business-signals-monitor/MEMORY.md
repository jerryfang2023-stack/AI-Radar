# Guanlan Business Signals Monitor Memory

Keep this file short. Add only durable lane-level lessons from repeated production failures.

## 2026-06-12

- The public/Hermes Top10 contract is lane-level, not only a Raw / Pool / Card detail. A healthy `frontstageSelection` or `frontstageCards` set is insufficient unless the public `top10` array exists and contains exactly 10 active-date items.
- Repeated Business Signals failures should land first in this lane monitor, then delegate to narrower skills such as `guanlan-raw-pool-card` for the specific repair.

- Business Signals should not depend on repeated late schedule loops. Keep 09:07 / 09:37 as the primary windows, then hand off to Hermes at 09:45 / 09:55 so failures are dispatched, reported, and routed to Codex before 10:00.
- Core Pool -> Signal Card entry should use six grouped gates: source auditability, evidence quality, business-signal scope, valid page type, commercial importance, and fact-type constraints. Keep field-level details as diagnostics under those gates; do not expose scattered field checks as separate Card policy or weaken source-first requirements to fill Top10.
